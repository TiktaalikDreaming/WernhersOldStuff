	description = Engine shroud and stabilizer wing for the A-9 rocket.  Larger (than the tiny A-4) control surfaces provide some control after the rocket has exhausted it's fuel supply.  This is the coolest looking post-A-4 design which happens to have completely failed wind tunnel testing back in the 40's.  Use at your own risk.
