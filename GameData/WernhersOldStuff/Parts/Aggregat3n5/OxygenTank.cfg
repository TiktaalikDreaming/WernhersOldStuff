	description = A shrouded dual fuel tank for the VK A-3.  No special storage is provided for the liquid oxygen tank, so it needs to be filled from storage just before launch.  A compressed gas tank is enclosed in the oxygen tank and provides pressure for both propellants to feed into the engine combustion chamber.
